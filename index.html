        <h2>What we’re building</h2>
        <p>
          Most creators are overthinking, under-shipping, and stuck in “someday”.
          We’re building a simple stack of tools, templates, and services so you can move now.

            Rapid prompts, templates, and guided flows that help you generate logos, social content,

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          We keep it simple so you can actually use it. No complicated software. No mystery stack.
        </p>
      </div>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          <h3>1. Start with the free tools</h3>
          <p>
            Use our prompts, templates, and flows to create your first version of a real, working brand —
            visuals, words, and simple systems.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Iterate in the open</h3>
          <p>
            Ship, test, and refine. Use what’s working; ignore what isn’t. We’ll keep sharing what we’re learning
            so you’re never starting from zero.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>3. Upgrade when it makes sense</h3>
          <p>
            When you’re ready, plug into our studio services or custom builds. You’re never paying for tool access —
            only for execution and perspective.
